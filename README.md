# KIIT TIME

**KIIT TIME** is a timetable app built with Flutter that displays KIIT students' section and elective subjects' timetables. By taking the student's roll number as input, the app retrieves and shows the relevant timetable. It integrates with _Supabase_ for backend services and includes local storage to ensure functionality even _without an internet connection._
